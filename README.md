# CS461, 462 and 463 Senior Project #
# Cloud-Based Algorithmic Trading Strategies for High-Performance Portfolios #
## Objectives ##
This project objective is to architect, implement and test a cloud-based portfolio recommendation
application. The application will include a UI for controlling the portfolio creation process and displaying
portfolio recommendations. It will include a database for storing stock market data, processed data,
trading strategy results, and other information. The application will also include services to process
data, explore data, learn trading strategies, and create portfolios. The deliverable will be the complete
application, testing results, and the standard development artifacts and documentation.
## Motivations ##
Most individuals have no idea about how to invest their money in the stock market. They invest in
company 401k's, IRA's, index funds, or stocks recommended by a financial â€œexpert. All these investment
strategies are sub-optimal and leave a lot of money on the table. Our motivation is to show that
portfolios based on algorithmic trading strategies are superior to other common portfolios (higher
return and lower risk).
